# Missing Files: api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll or msvcp140.dll

Versions of the Saleae Logic Windows software starting with 1.2.11 require the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 runtime to be installed in order to work. This is installed automatically when the software is installed. If you are using the standalone version of the software on Windows, it needs to be installed manually.

Details for the standalone installation can be found here:

{% endcontent-ref %}

If you see either of the below errors, it is possible that the runtime is not installed properly.

* "The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer."
* "The program can’t start because vcruntime140.dll is missing from your computer."

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1. Uninstall and re-install the Logic software.
2.  Manually install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 runtime, which you can download here:

    Be sure to select the x64 version if you are using a 64-bit version of Windows.

    After you have installed the runtime, try restarting the computer and running Logic again.
3. If the above steps don't solve the issue, please try installing and running version 1.2.10 of our software. You can find it below.
