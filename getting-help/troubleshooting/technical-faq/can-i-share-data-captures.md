Can I Share Data Captures with Others?

The Saleae Logic software can save and load captures. Simply use Options -> Save Capture and Options -> Open Capture / Setup from the main options menu in order to load and save \*.logicdata files.

No device is required to open saved captures. Simply ask the recipient to install the software on their computer so they can open the file. Please note that they will need the same or newer version to do so.

For more information about version requirements, see below.
