# Is My Capture Data Private?

{% hint style="info" %}
The information provided in this article applies to the latest production software downloadable [here](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/). The software collects some additional usage data that are not mentioned in this article, though captured data is never shared with us. The user can opt-out of providing such usage data via the Options menu.
{% endhint %}

We understand that many of our customers work on confidential projects. Because of this, captured data is never shared with us.

Please note that the Logic software communicates with our servers in the following ways:

* Crash Reports - Our software allows you to enable crash reporting. When enabled, crash reports are automatically uploaded to us. You will be prompted to enable this when you run the software for the first time, and this setting can be changed at any time in the Preferences menu.
* Device ID - Each time Logic is used on a new PC, its unique device ID is collected to download the calibration file for that particular device. You can learn more about this in the link below:

{% endcontent-ref %}

* Software Updates - By default, new software updates are automatically downloaded. You can disable automatic downloads in the Preferences menu.
* Usage Statistics - If this setting is enabled, usage statistics are sent to our servers. Please remember that captured data is never sent to us. You will be prompted to enable this when you run the software for the first time, and this setting can be changed at any time in the Preferences menu.
