# Test Clip Differences - Gen 1 & Gen 2

On our accessories page, you may have noticed 2 versions of our test clips.

* [Test Clips 8-Pack \(Gen 2\)](https://usd.saleae.com/collections/accessories/products/test-clips-93)
* [Test Clips 9-Pack \(Gen 1\)](https://usd.saleae.com/collections/accessories/products/test-clips-92)

The Gen 1 version of the test clips is the version that comes with Original Logic and Logic16. The Gen 2 version of the test clips is the version that comes with Logic 4, Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, Logic Pro 16. Although each version is associated with a specific product family, they are cross compatible and will work with any of our products. You may use Gen 1 test clips with our Gen 2 product family, and vice versa.

The differences are highlighted below:

* Gen 1 sells in a 9-Pack while Gen 2 sells in an 8-Pack. This is to accommodate the input channel structure of our products. For our Gen 1 products, every 8 channels is paired with 1 ground wire, and so, a 9-pack of test clips would be ideal for a replacement set. For our Gen 2 products, each channel is paired with a ground. Therefore, every 4 channels will require 8 test clips.
* The look and feel will be slightly different, but the functionality and compatibility remains the same across both generations.
