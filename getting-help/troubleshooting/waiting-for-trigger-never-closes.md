# The 'Waiting for Trigger' Window Never Closes

If the software never sees your trigger, then it might be set up incorrectly.

The first thing we recommend is capturing without the trigger so you can see what's really there. Then you can double-check that the pattern you're looking for is really there.

Also, make sure you only have the trigger levels that you need. When you select a single edge and several high or low states on other channels, the trigger will only occur if that edge occurs when the other channels are in those states.

The trigger mechanism is in the software and runs using the same system that displays data. So it's impossible for it to miss something that the software can see when running without a trigger.

That said, sometimes complex triggering can be a pain, so please let us know if you need any help.
