# Getting your Software Crash Logs

Our support team may request for a copy of the software logs generated by the Logic 2 app during crashes. These log files can be found in the location below.

{% hint style="info" %}
On Windows, please note that you will need to [**show hidden files, folders, and drives**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_10) to see your AppData folder.
{% endhint %}

```
Windows 10 & 11:
%APPDATA%\Logic\logs

MacOS:
~/Library/Logs/Logic2/

Linux Ubuntu:
~/.config/Logic/logs
```

You should find folders with names like `2025-11-25_13-51-28_d8b62de1-3ebc-467c-b19a-184e07fc04d5` containing a graph.io log file. We would like to get the logs from when you experienced the crashes, but if you're not sure which ones those are, feel free to zip and send us the whole set.
