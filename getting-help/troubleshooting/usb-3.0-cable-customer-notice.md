# USB 3.0 Cable Customer Notice (2017)

We don't know exactly when it started, but we know that some units shipped in December 2017 and January 2018 were affected.

We are now including an additional USB 3.0 cable from a good source with units shipping now. This only applies to units shipped directly from Saleae, and it may be a little longer before units shipped from distributors are corrected.

The following behavior has been observed:

1. The device does not connect properly to the software when connected over USB 3.0.
2. The device does not connect properly over USB 3.0 on some computers, but it does work on others.
3. The device connects over USB 2.0, even when connected to a USB 3.0 port with the included cable.

The issue appears to be borderline, which is why it does not affect all users. In some cases, changing ports or hubs will solve the problem.

We're still doing an investigation now. In the meantime, if you are experiencing any problems with a new Logic Pro 8 or Logic Pro 16 on some or all computers, please contact us.

If you are located inside the US, we can ship you a replacement USB 3.0 cable directly.

If you are located outside the US, we would prefer to reimburse you for the cable so you can replace it. If you purchased directly from us and had your unit shipped internationally, we can apply a partial refund to your order to cover the cost of a replacement cable.

If you are located outside the US and did not purchase the unit directly from us, we can arrange a refund through PayPal.

If you are located outside the US but cannot easily purchase a cable from a local distributor, we can still ship you a replacement cable directly.

**To get a replacement USB 3.0 cable directly from US, please send your shipping address and telephone number to** [**Saleae support**](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.**

We are currently recommending this replacement cable from Amazon: [http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-3-0-Cable-Micro-B/dp/B00NH12R1O](http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-3-0-Cable-Micro-B/dp/B00NH12R1O)

In all cases, either the 3-ft., 6-ft., or 9-ft. cable solved the reported issue so far.
