# HLA Fails to Display Special Characters

When using your custom HLA, you may notice that some special characters may display incorrectly in its decoded bubble. Despite this issue, the special character should still be correctly displayed under the Data Table. For example:

* `=` displays as `&#3D`
* `"` displays as `&quot;`

### Workaround

Although this is currently an issue we need to address, we do have a workaround for this. In summary, you can use triple braces to get around the issue. For example:

&#x20;`"Value: {{{ data.value }}}"`

We've also noted a few forum posts below, as some users have provided examples for how they have implemented this workaround.
