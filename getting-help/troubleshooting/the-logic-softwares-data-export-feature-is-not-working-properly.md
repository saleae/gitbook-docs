# Data Export Is Not Working

First, please review the data export information found below.

{% endcontent-ref %}

To best debug this issue, please send a copy of the \*.logicdata capture file to [Saleae support](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). If the file is too large to attach but under 1 GB, please send us a Dropbox link if you use Dropbox. If not, let us know, and we can send you a Dropbox file upload request.

Once we have the file here, we can try exporting it to see if we can reproduce the problem.
