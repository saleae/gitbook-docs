# Error Function: Device2::SetupDevice

This error only affects Logic software versions 1.2.29 and older and has since been fixed in 1.2.40. Specifically, the logic software will run fine while a logic analyzer is not connected, but the moment a logic analyzer is connected, the Logic software will crash.

To solve this issue, we recommend using the following version of the software.

* [Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/)
* Logic 1.2.40 (Download link provided below)
