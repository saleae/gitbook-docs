# Ideas & Feedback

Want to **share an idea for a new feature**? Post your idea on our [Ideas Forum](https://ideas.saleae.com/b/feature-requests/)!

You can share, vote, and comment on ideas there. This helps us prioritize our roadmap and gives us an idea of what features matter most to you.

You can also submit feedback from directly within our Logic 2 App by clicking on the feedback button on the bottom right.
