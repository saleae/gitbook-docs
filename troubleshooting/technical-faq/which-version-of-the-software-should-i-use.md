# Which Version of the Software Should I Use?

In almost all cases, you should use the latest release of the Saleae software, Logic 2. It can be found here below:

## Logic 1.x (older)

#### Logic 1.x Beta

The latest version of our older Logic 1.x software can be downloaded below. At the moment, Logic 2 does not support our Automation API. To use the Automation API in the meantime, the older Logic 1.x software is required. We plan to add support for the Automation API into Logic 2 in the future.

**OS X 10.4 and OS X 10.5**

The last version of the software to support OS X 10.4 and OS X 10.5 was the Logic software version 1.1.15. You can download the special releases for this here:

**OS X 10.6**

The last release of the Saleae software to support OS X 10.6 was 1.1.18, which you can find here:

{% endcontent-ref %}

**CentOs**

Due to unknown issues with the QT 5 upgrade, we were unable to maintain support for CentOs 6.x and future releases. The last version of our software to use QT 4 was 1.1.34, and a special compatibility release was made that runs on CentOs 6.x. Be sure to get the compatibility release.

**Other General Notes**

If you are using one of the newer products (Logic 4, Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, Logic Pro 16), you will not be able to use older versions of the software. The only older version you should consider using is if you are on Linux and the latest software is not working (as in the case of CentOs 6.x). In that case, you should try either the compatibility release of the latest version or the compatibility release of the 1.1.34 software, as mentioned in the CentOs section.

The original Logic device is supported on all releases, including the original Windows-only software, versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.34.

The original Logic16 is supported over versions 1.1.14 and newer.
