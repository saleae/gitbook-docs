# What Is the Normal Behavior of the LED?

All Saleae products, except the original Logic, have an LED. The Gen2 products—Logic 4, Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, Logic Pro 16—have RGB LEDs. The original Logic 16 has a green LED.

The LED is first turned on by the software once the device has successfully connected to the Logic software. The LED does not turn off when the software closes.

During error situations, the LED will blink red. More information on this behavior can be found in the support article below:
