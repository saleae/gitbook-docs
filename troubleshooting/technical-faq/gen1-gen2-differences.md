# What Is the Difference between Logic/Logic16 (Gen1) and Logic 8/Pro 8/Pro 16 (Gen2)?

The original Logic and Logic16 were discontinued in mid-2014 when they were replaced with a new line of products—Logic 4, Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, and Logic Pro 16.

The new Logic 8 is significantly more advanced than the original Logic device.

The original Logic could record signals at 24 MSPS on 8 channels and supported IO voltages between 2.5 volts and 5.0 volts.

The new Logic 8 is significantly more advanced. First, Logic 8 allows you to disable unused channels in order to achieve higher sampling rates on the remaining channels. Logic 8 can sample at 25 MSPS on all 8 channels, 40 MSPS on 7 channels, 50 MSPS on 6 channels, and 100 MSPS on 3 channels.

In addition to the higher sample rates, Logic 8 also supports a wider range of input voltages and has dramatically improved over-voltage protection, allowing it to record signals outside of the 0–5 volt range directly, such as RS-232 serial.

Finally, all the new products, including the new Logic 8, include analog inputs. All 8 inputs can be used to record in analog, digital, or both.

The new Logic Pro 16 is a huge improvement over the original Logic16. The new Pro unit supports USB 3.0, increasing the maximum bandwidth of the device by a factor of 6. When recording digital inputs, the device can sample at 500 MSPS on 4 channels or at 100 MSPS on all 16 channels. The previous Logic16 was limit to 16 MSPS on all 16 channels.

Like the other new devices, the Logic Pro 16 supports analog sampling on all inputs and has better over-voltage protection and more IO threshold options than the original Logic16.
