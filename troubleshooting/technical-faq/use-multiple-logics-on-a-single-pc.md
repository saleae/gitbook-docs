# Can I Use Multiple Logics on a Single PC?

Unfortunately this is not possible. The software does not support sampling from more than one device at a time from the same PC, even when running multiple instances of the software. We would like to make that possible by running multiple instances of the software, but the captures would not be related, and devices on the same USB host controller would have to share bandwidth, reducing their maximum sample rates.
