# What Options Are There to Export Multiple Protocol Analyzer Results into the Same File?

The Saleae software has two protocol export systems as detailed at the end of the article below.&#x20;

[using-protocol-analyzers.md](../../user-guide/using-logic/using-protocol-analyzers.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The second option—export protocol search results—will export the entire search results. By default, that will include the results of all analyzers. These results can be filtered by keyword or time range and can be filtered by analyzer.

### Exporting Multiple Analyzers of the Same Type

The protocol analyzers can be renamed in order to differentiate between multiple analyzers of the same type. This will be reflected in the export as well. You can refer to the instructions below.
