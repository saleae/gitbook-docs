# Does the Saleae Software Support the Original Logic and Logic 16?

The latest Saleae Logic software supports the Original Logic and Logic 16 devices, even though these devices don't show up as simulation options in the software.

Simulation mode allows potential users to explore the features of the software before deciding to buy the unit. Since the Original Logic and Logic 16 devices have been discontinued, we have removed the simulation option for them.

You can read more about simulation mode below.
