## The Add Analyzer Menu Is Not Displaying

The add analyzer menu will not appear if no digital channels are enabled for the active device or if you are on a different, previously captured tab which has no digital channels present.

We will change the UI for this in the future to make it more obvious why protocol analyzers cannot be added under these situations, as currently all protocol analyzers only operate on digital channels.
