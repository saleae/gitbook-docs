# Error: An unknown error occurred during device connection

This error message may appear during device operation, or upon connecting your Logic device. This error appears when the Logic app detects that a device gets physically disconnected from the PC during initialization. This could be due to a bad USB connection, a faulty USB host controller driver, a fauly Logic pod, or other unkown reasons which might cause the USB connection to time-out during initialization.
