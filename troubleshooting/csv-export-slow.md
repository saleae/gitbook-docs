# CSV Export is Slow

We've received a few recent reports of export speed being slow when exporting raw data to a csv file. Unfortunately, exporting to a csv file has its limits, and the time it takes to process the data depends on the following:

* Number of digital transitions in your data
* Number of analog samples in your data
* Your PC specifications

### Performance Expectations

We might be able to squeeze out a bit more performance in terms of speed, though due to the csv file format itself, the speed increase may be in the order of a few 10s of percent. We wouldn't be able to drastically increase the speed by 10x.

### Troubleshooting Steps

Besides the csv format being quite inefficient, one area that might be causing a bottleneck in speed is the target location for the export file. For example, saving to a network drive or an external usb drive will cause limitations in export speed.

We plan to improve the performance of our software, but in the meantime, here are some workarounds.â€Œ

1. Export only a section of the data
2. Export only a few channels
3. Export to binary rather than CSV. We also have a sample python script to read binary data (provided in the link below, at the bottom of the article).

### How Many Digital Transitions are in my Captured Data? <a href="#how-many-digital-transitions-are-in-my-captured-data" id="how-many-digital-transitions-are-in-my-captured-data"></a>

Since export performance is related to how many digital transitions occur in your data, you can check this by using our built-in Clock Stats measurement extension. Install the extension (it should be installed by default) and SHIFT+drag across your entire range of digital data to count the number of rising edges and falling edges in your capture.

### Exporting via Binary File - A Much Faster Approach

An alternative approach (much faster and produces a smaller file) would be to export to a binary file. More details on the binary file format can be found in the link below.
