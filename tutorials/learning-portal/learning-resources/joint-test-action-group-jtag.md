# Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)

JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is often used to program and debug microcontrollers, embedded systems, FPGAs, and much more. It has a wide range of capabilities and is supported by a large amount of hardware. It's extremely flexible and can be used for many other purposes. When using the JTAG analyzer, make sure you are sampling at least 4 times faster than the clock speed to accurately capture the data.
