### About Windows 8 Support

Starting with Logic 2.4.14, we no longer support Windows 8. For Windows 8 support, please use version 2.4.13 or prior, which can be downloaded [here](https://ideas.saleae.com/f/changelog/).

To provide some background information on this, the version of Electron we currently use no longer supports Windows 8. Electron has released a [deprecation statement](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/windows-7-to-8-1-deprecation-notice) on this topic.
