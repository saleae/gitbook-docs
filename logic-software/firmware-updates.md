# Firmware Updates

There is no need to manage downloading firmware updates to Saleae Logic products. As long as the latest Logic software is used, your Logic hardware will continue to run on the latest firmware. You will only need to ensure you are running the latest version of the software, which can be downloaded below.

The Logic software downloads the firmware to the device every time it is connected to the PC as shown in the image below. Before this point, the Logic device is acting as a simple bootloader.
