# Viewing I2C Addresses as 8-bit

Our built-in I2C analyzer displays I2C addresses as a 7-bit value + ACK/NAK bit by default.

In certain scenarios, it may be preferred to view the address field as an 8-bit value (incorporating the R/W bit).
We've added a high level analyzer (HLA) extension that allows for this feature.

1\. Navigate to the Extensions panel of the software on the right\
2\. Find the "I2C 8-Bit Address Display extension" and click Install

4\. When the setup window appears, select your I2C analyzer\
5\. Afterwards, your I2C addresses should appear as an 8-bit value as shown below.
