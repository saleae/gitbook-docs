## What Annotations Are Supported?

The software supports a few different annotations:

* Measurement Annotation

    Used to compute statistics over a range of time on a single channel

* Bookmark Annotation

    Used to mark a specific location and zoom level in a capture

* Timing Marker Pair

    Used to place one or two timing markers and measure the distance between them

All annotations have editable names. You can also automatically pan the display back to any measurement by clicking on its icon on the annotations panel.

We don't have a note annotation but would like to add one. In the meantime, I recommend using a bookmark annotation with a short description in the title.

Annotations are covered in the user's guide here: [https://trello.com/c/E5FWiUx7](https://trello.com/c/E5FWiUx7).
