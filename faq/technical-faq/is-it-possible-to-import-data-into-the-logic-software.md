# Is It Possible to Import Data into the Logic Software?

It is not possible to import data into the Logic software. It can only take captures or open captures that were saved with the Logic software.

It is also not possible to import a previously exported CSV file back into the Logic software.

You may want to take a look at other wave form viewing tools:

* [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net)
* [PulseView](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView)
* [List of other waveform viewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform\_viewer)

If you need to analyze protocol data, you may want to use [PulseView](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView) and [Sigrok](https://sigrok.org)
