# Does Saleae Offer Demo Units or Units on Loan?

Saleae does not offer an evaluation program for its products.

However, all purchases made directly from Saleae, either from our website at www.saleae.com or via PO, have a 180-day return policy. If at any time during that period you want to return the product, you can do so and receive a full refund, including shipping. For more information about returns, see this article:
