# How Can I Find the Current Status of My Order?

When an order is placed online, you should immediately receive an email confirmation. If you are missing that confirmation, [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can help with that.

When your order ships, another email is sent containing the tracking number. If you have already received that email, you may use the tracking link included to monitor your shipment's progress.

If for some reason you did not receive any of the emails mentioned above, please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and include the order ID number, PO number, or any other identifying information so we can locate your order in our system.

Orders placed online at www.saleae.com usually ship within one business day, unless one or more of the items in the order are out of stock. If any items are out of stock, you should have been required to check a box on the cart page acknowledging this.
