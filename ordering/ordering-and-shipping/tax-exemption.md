# Tax & VAT Exemption

## Tax Exemption Process for U.S. Orders

1. Please ensure that your tax exemption certificate meets the requirements for your particular state. You can refer to [California's Resale Certificate Requirements](https://www.taxes.ca.gov/Sales_and_Use_Tax/ResaleCertificate.html) as an example.
2. Before placing your online order at [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/), please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let us know you would like sales tax removed on future orders. Include an attachment of your tax exemption certificate.
3. Our support team will reply within 1 business day after the tax exemption certificate is submitted.
4. After approval, your future orders on [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/) will be tax-exempt when using the email you have provided to us.
5. When placing your order, ensure that taxes have been successfully removed before submitting your order. If taxes still appear on our check out page, please do not submit your order and [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can help look into it for you!

### Refund of Tax Charges

If the order has already shipped, then the sales tax has already been collected. Please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach your tax exemption certificate. After approval, we can provide a refund of the tax charges. We can only process tax refunds for orders placed directly on our website at [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/).
