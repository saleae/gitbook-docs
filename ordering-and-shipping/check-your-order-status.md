# Check your Order Status

After placing an order through our website at www.saleae.com, you will be contacted via email with your order summary, which should include your order number with us. In addition, another email will be sent to you which will include your tracking information once your order is shipped.

If for some reason you did not receive the above email, please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let us know your order number and we will be happy to share your order status with you. Your order number will be in the format of "XYZ-12345" (with XYZ representing the currency, and 12345 representing the number for your order).

If you don't have your order number handy, please share any other information on your order that might help us locate it. For example:

* Shipping and billing address
* Recipient name
* Email address of the order placer
* The date when the order was placed
