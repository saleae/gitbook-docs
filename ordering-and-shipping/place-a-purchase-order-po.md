# Place a Purchase Order (PO)

{% hint style="info" %}
In most cases, for a smoother and faster ordering experience, we recommend ordering online through our website at [www.saleae.com](http://www.saleae.com) with a credit/purchasing card, or PayPal. Domestic US online orders completed by 12pm PST on business days ship same day.&#x20;

If you are unable to pay in advance or by credit card/PayPal, we also have distributors world-wide that might be able to accommodate credit payment terms. We've provided a link to our list of distributors below.
