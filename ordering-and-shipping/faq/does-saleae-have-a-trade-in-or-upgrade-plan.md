# Does Saleae Have a Trade-In or Upgrade Plan?

Saleae does not offer a trade-in or upgrade plan. However, if you purchased a device within the last 180 days, you can return it for a full refund \(including shipping both ways\). That will allow you to upgrade or downgrade your product at any time in the first 6 months after buying it.
