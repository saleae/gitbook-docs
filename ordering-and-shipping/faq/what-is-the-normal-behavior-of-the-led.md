# What Is the Normal Behavior of the LED?

All Saleae products except the original Logic have an LED. The new products—Logic 4, Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, Logic Pro 16—have RGB LEDs. The original Logic 16 has a green LED.

The LED is first turned on by the software once the device has connected to the software. Currently, the LED does not turn off when the software closes.

To turn off the LED, you can either directly turn it off in the software or remove the device.
