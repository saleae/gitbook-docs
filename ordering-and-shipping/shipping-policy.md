# Shipping Policy

### Shipping Options

To check the shipping options available in your country, simply add an item to the cart on [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/) and select your country. Afterwards, click "Checkout" and enter your shipping information to view the available shipping options and shipping cost.

### International Shipping - Duties and Taxes

Saleae regularly ships internationally.

If you are shipping to a country outside the US, there will likely be additional charges for duties and taxes, due on receipt. 

In some locations \(i.e., most of the EU\), we offer the ability to pre-pay import taxes such as VAT. If this is the case, we can charge you the customs fees and it will be clearly indicated in the shopping cart. Afterwards, you will not get a customs bill. You will see what options are available on the cart page.

### **Order Emails and Tracking Numbers**

As soon as your order is placed, you will receive an email from us confirming the details. If you need to make any changes, please contact us as soon as possible.

After your order ships, you will receive a second email with a tracking number and a link to check the tracking number. Please note that the tracking number may not appear in the system for up to 24 hours.

### Where Will My Order Ship From?

For **online orders** placed at [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/), the origin of the shipment is determined by the currency your order was paid in. You cannot select the currency. Our cart page selects it automatically depending on the shipping country. Please refer to the table below.

### Can You Ship to a PO Box Address?

### **In-Stock Items**

Normally, orders placed before 12 pm PST on weekdays are shipped the same day. The stocking status \(in stock or out of stock\) is displayed under each item in your cart.

### **Out-of-Stock Items**

If an item is not in stock, an estimated time of shipment is displayed in your cart. This is our estimate, but sometimes it may take longer than indicated. If any of your items are out of stock, your entire order will be held until it can be shipped in full, but you may contact us to make other arrangements.
