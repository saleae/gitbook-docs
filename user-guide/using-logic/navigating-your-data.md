### **Jumping between Digital Edges**

Sometimes digital data come in packets with long periods of idle in between.

To jump over idle periods, move your mouse to the far right or far left of a particular channel. A jump button will appear. Note that these buttons are not visible until you move your mouse cursor over the area where they are located. They will also only appear when you have captured data. They will not appear when the graph area is blank before a capture is taken.

Click this button to jump to the next digital transition on that channel.

You can also use the keyboard shortcuts N and P \("next" and "previous"\). The keyboard shortcut applies to the channel whose jump button was last pressed.

### **Scrolling through Channels**

Sometimes you may have more channels displayed than can fit on the screen at the same time.

Move your mouse over the channel labels on the left side of the software and scroll up and down with your mouse wheel.

Alternatively, there is a slider bar at the right side of the channel graphs.
