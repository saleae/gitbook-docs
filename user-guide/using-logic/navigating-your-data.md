# Navigating Your Data

In the Logic 2 software, several methods exist for navigating your data. Here are some of the most common methods.

### Marquee Zoom: Zooming by Drag Select

Marquee zoom (i.e. zooming in by drag-selecting a region of the waveform) is available on analog channels.

* Use `Alt-Drag` for XY Range Zoom&#x20;
* `Ctrl-Drag Up/Down` for Y (Voltage) Range Zoom
* `Ctrl-Drag Left/Right` for X (Time) Range Zoom

### Zooming, Panning, & Jumping to Edges

### X-Axis Discrete Zoom Level

In addition to using the keyboard shortcuts described above for zooming in and zooming out, the Logic 2 software allows you to set a discrete zoom level. The setting for this is located at the bottom-right of the software as shown in the image below.

### Y-Axis Zoom for Analog Channels

The Y-axis zoom level for analog channels can be adjusted by hovering over the icon shown in the image below. It will appear at the top-right of an analog channel when hovering over that channel.

While hovering over the icon, several Y-axis zoom adjustment options become available as shown in the image below. These include:

* Y zoom-out / zoom-in / Y fit
* XY zoom-out / zoom-in / XY fit
