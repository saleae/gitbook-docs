# Demo Mode

When a Saleae Logic device is not connected to the PC while the Logic 2 software is running, an option is provided to run the software in Demo Mode. This allows users to test the capabilities of the software without having to own our logic analyzer.

In this mode, when a data capture is run, randomly generated simulation data will populate the recording as shown below.

### Generating Analyzer Simulation Data

When an analyzer is added to digital channels while in Demo mode, the simulation data on those digital channels will generate analyzer-specific simulation data as shown in the image below.
