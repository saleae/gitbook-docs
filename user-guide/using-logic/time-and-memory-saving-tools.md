### **Faster post-processing of analog captures**

After a capture, analog data can be processed faster if Upsampled Pipeline is disabled.

### **Faster post-processing of decoded protocols**

You can disable the _Decoded Protocols_ search window located on the bottom-right of the software. This will disable software indexing of the decoded protocols and will remove the ability to search protocol results. This allows for faster post-processing of decoded protocols when using a protocol analyzer.

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**

The software includes various keyboard shortcuts to set up and start captures, add measurements, and utilize other functions that will help save the user time.

### **Saving and Loading Software Settings**

The software settings can be saved and loaded at a later time, allowing the user to recall a particular setup. This is especially useful when jumping back and forth between multiple test setups.

### **Reducing Capture File Disk Usage**

The file size of a capture file \(.logicdata file\) can be significantly reduced by zipping it to a compressed folder. This is especially useful when sending your capture file over the network.
