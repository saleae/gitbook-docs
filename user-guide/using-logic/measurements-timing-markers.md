# Measurements, Timing Markers & Notes

### Measurements

Measurements in the Logic 2 software can be added via the "Timing Markers, Measurements & Notes" side panel button on the right. Once the panel is opened, add a measurement by clicking the "+" button next to "Measurements." Afterwards, you can click and drag across your desired channel and waveform region to add a measurement box. As a shortcut, you can hold SHIFT while clicking and dragging across your waveform to add a measurement box.

{% endembed %}

The measurements that are made (called metrics) depend on the type of data you are measuring (analog or digital) and the installed measurement extensions in the software.&#x20;

#### Installing More Measurements

The "Clock Stats" and the "Voltage RMS" measurement extensions are installed by default. You can also view and install custom submitted Measurement Extensions via the "Extensions" panel button on the right of the software. More information on this can be found below.

### Timing Markers

Timing Markers in the Logic 2 software can be added via the "Timing Markers & Measurements" side panel button on the right. Two types of timing markers exist: (1) Single Marker and (2) Marker Pair.

#### Adding Notes to Timing Markers and Editing Colors

By clicking on the timing markers at the top of the software, text notes can be added and colors can be changed. You can also delete timing markers from here by clicking on the "trashcan" icon.

### Capture Notes

A Notes section can be found in the "Timing Markers, Measurements & Notes" side panel button on the right as shown in the image below. This allows you to type in notes that are relevant for your captured data. The panel can also be resized both vertically and horizontally by hovering your mouse pointer on the separating edges of the panel.

## Logic 1.x

If you are using the older Logic 1.x software, the following images and instructions apply.

### **Digital Instantaneous Measurements**

To see instantaneous measurements while hovering over a digital channel recording, right-click the digital waveform and make sure "Show Digital Instantaneous Measurement" is checked. You can also select which measurements are made, and you can save the measurement so it stays persistent on the waveform, even when the mouse is not hovering over it.&#x20;

### **Analog Instantaneous Measurements**

To see instantaneous measurements while hovering over an analog channel recording, right-click the analog waveform and make sure "Show Analog Instantaneous Measurement" is checked. You can also select which measurements are made, and you can save the measurement so it stays persistent on the waveform, even when the mouse is not hovering over it.&#x20;

### **Using Annotations**

All annotations are listed in the Annotations sidebar at the top right of the software. By default, the Annotations sidebar will contain a Timing Marker annotation.

### **Using Timing Markers**

Timing markers can be used to measure elapsed time between any two locations in your data. By default, the Annotations sidebar will contain a Timing Marker annotation.

To place a timing marker, first press the A1 or A2 buttons.

To cancel placing a timing marker, right-click.

You can also place timing markers with the keyboard's 1 and 2 keys.

### **Using Bookmarks**

A Bookmark is simply a recording of your exact position and zoom level in your data. By making a bookmark, you can quickly zoom back to this area again later.

To add a Bookmark, click the Plus button on the Annotations panel and select Bookmark.

### **Using Measurements (Persistent)**

Adding a Measurement allows you to add a permanent annotation to your data for later reference. In addition, Measurement Annotations allow for more sophisticated computations than the temporary measurements that always appear at the mouse cursor. For example, you can compute the average duty cycle across thousands of pulses.

To add a Measurement Annotation, click the Plus button on the Annotations panel and select Measurement.
