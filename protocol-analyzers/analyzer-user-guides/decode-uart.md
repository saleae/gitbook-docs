# Decode UART

The Saleae Logic software supports decoding UART communications using the provided Async Serial Analyzer in the Logic software.

A UART \(Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter\) is a hardware block most commonly found in microcontrollers and processors. Its primary job is to send and receive asynchronous serial data to and from other UART devices via two data lines: TX and RX.

Typically, the serial data are organized in the following format:

The Async Serial Analyzer in the Logic software can be configured for various data sizes, stop bits, and parity settings. For details on setting this up, please see the article below.
