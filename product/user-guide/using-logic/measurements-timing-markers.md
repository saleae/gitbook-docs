# Measurements, Timing Markers & Notes

### Measurements

Measurements in the Logic 2 software can be added via the "Timing Markers, Measurements & Notes" side panel button on the right. Once the panel is opened, add a measurement by clicking the "+" button next to "Measurements." Afterwards, you can click and drag across your desired channel and waveform region to add a measurement box. As a shortcut, you can hold SHIFT while clicking and dragging across your waveform to add a measurement box.

The measurements that are made (called metrics) depend on the type of data you are measuring (analog or digital) and the installed measurement extensions in the software.&#x20;

#### Installing More Measurements

The "Clock Stats" and the "Voltage RMS" measurement extensions are installed by default. You can also view and install custom submitted Measurement Extensions via the "Extensions" panel button on the right of the software. More information on this can be found below.

### Capture Notes

A Notes section can be found in the "Timing Markers, Measurements & Notes" side panel button on the right as shown in the image below. This allows you to type in notes that are relevant for your captured data. The panel can also be resized both vertically and horizontally by hovering your mouse pointer on the separating edges of the panel.
