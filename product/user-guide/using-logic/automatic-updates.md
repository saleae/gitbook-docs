# Automatic Updates

The Logic 2 app has the ability to keep itself updated via automatic updates. This happens in the background, and a popup notification within the app will notify the user when an update has completed downloading and is ready to install.

The update can also be installed from within the app by clicking the Options button at the bottom-right, then clicking About. From there, you can click on the "Update Available!" link to re-open the pop-up window above.

### Disabe Automatic Updates

In some cases, users may prefer to manually update their software. Automatic downloads of updates can be disabled by clicking the Options button at the bottom-right, then clicking Preferences. Scroll to the bottom of the Preferences window to reveal the option to disable automatic updates.
