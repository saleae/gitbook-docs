# Extension Installation

There are 2 methods to installing an extension. You can install an extension from within the software via our in-app Extensions Marketplace, or you can install it via local source files on your PC.

### Extension Installation within the Software

This will be the easiest method of installing an extension. Clicking on the Extensions button on the right will open up a list of published extensions from us and from the community. Afterwards, you can click "Install" for the extension of your choice.

### Install Extensions Manually

In some cases, the extensions list may not appear properly within the Extensions panel of the software. This may be due to security settings such as a firewall, or simply having the PC offline. To get around this, extensions can be found on GitHub and can be downloaded manually using the following steps.

1. On a computer where the marketplace loads, click the extension of interest so that it is highlighted. This will open up the extension information within the software.&#x20;
2. Click the "Repository" link. This opens the [github.com](http://github.com/) repository for that extension.
3. Click the green "Code" button, and select download as zip.
4. Extract the zip file anywhere.
5. In the Logic 2 software, on the Extensions panel, click the "three-dots" menu icon, select "Load Existing Extension..." and select the downloaded extension.json file.
