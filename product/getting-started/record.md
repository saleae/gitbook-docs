Note that if you do not have a logic analyzer plugged into your computer, a popup window will appear at the bottom of the software, notifying that there is no connected device, and that demo data will be generated.

To learn more, see the [Device Settings](https://saleae.gitbook.io/docs/user-guide/using-logic/collecting-data-and-device-settings) section of the User Guide.
