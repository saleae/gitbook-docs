# Configure

With the logic analyzer plugged into your computer, start the _Logic 2_ software. If this is the first time you are using your logic analyzer, the _Logic 2_ software will automatically download a calibration file for your particular analyzer. If you do not have access to the Internet, refer to the [Device Calibration](https://saleae.gitbook.io/docs/user-guide/device-calibration) section of the User Guide.

Before you capture any data, click on the _Capture Settings_ button to configure the logic analyzer. Select the sampling rate, capture duration, ports, voltage, and other settings relevant to your preferred capture parameters.

To learn more, see the [Device Settings](https://saleae.gitbook.io/docs/user-guide/using-logic/collecting-data-and-device-settings) section of the User Guide.
