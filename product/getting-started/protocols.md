# Protocols

The _Logic 2_ software has the ability to decode a variety of protocols, including SPI, I2C, serial, 1-Wire, CAN, I2S/PCM, and many more! To create your own protocol analyzer, refer to our [Protocol Analyzer SDK](https://saleae.gitbook.io/docs/saleae-api-and-sdk/protocol-analyzer-sdk).

Click the **Analyzers** panel button and then the **+** button to add a protocol analyzer. Once added, the protocol can be displayed in binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or ASCII, and information is shown above each segment of data \(e.g. byte\) in the viewport as well as in the _Data_ Table.
