# Trigger

You can set the logic analyzer to begin recording only when it sees a particular edge or pulse by selecting **Trigger** from within the _Capture Settings_ panel. Once the data has been collected, you can navigate directly to the trigger point by clicking on the small yellow tab above the recorded waveforms.
